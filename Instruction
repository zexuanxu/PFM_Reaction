Instruction

1. Governing equations:

Dimensional equations:
Please see equation (24), (25) and (54) in Xu and Meakin, 2008, Phase-field modeling of solute prcipitation and dissolution, The Journal of Chemical Physics, 129, 014705.

Dimensionless equations:
Please see equation (12)-(14) in Xu and Meakin, 2011, Phase-field modeling of two-dimensional solute precipitation/dissolution: Solid fingers and diffusion-limited precipitation, The Journal of Chemical Physics, 129, 014705.

Weak forms:
Please see the document "Equations of the phase field model of reaction.docx" in directory doc.


2. Compile and Execute

To compile and generate the executable file, simply type:

	make 

or,
 
	make -j[jobs]	// [jobs] is the number of jobs to run simultaneously.

the executable file ./pfm_reaction-opt will be generated.

To run the code:

	mpirun -n -[nodes] pfm_reaction-opt -i [input file name]	// Parellel running

or,

	./pfm_reaction-opt -i [input file name]				// Serial running

run tests, simply type:
 
	./run_tests


3. Code framework

		// AC* kernels mean the Allen-Cahn phase field equation.
		// Conc* kernels mean the concentration diffusion/reaction equation.
		// For more detail, please refer to each kernel file.

	materials:
		ACMaterials		// All parameters needed in the Allan-Cahn phase field equation (dimensional case)
		ConcMaterials		// All parameters needed in the concentration diffusion/reaction equation (dimensional case)
		DimensionlessMaterials.C	// All parameters needed in both two equations (Dimensionless case)

directory examples: some examples	 
directory tests: some test cases    
	// The examples and tests cases are almost the same.
	// The only difference is that the test cases are only 2 to 3 time steps (because the test cases should be short to run) 
		
	dendrite_growth_highreaction	// Dendrite growth case with high reaction rate (compare with diffusivity)
	dendrite_growth_lowreaction	// Dendrite growth case with low reaction rate (compare with diffusivity)
	dendrite_growth_sidebranch	// Dendrite growth case with high reaction rate and random noise to generate sidebranch
	dissolution			// A dissolution case
	dissolution_point		// A point source dissolution case
	dissolution_point_convection	// A point source dissolution case with convection
